# Rapidly-exploring-Random-Trees(RRT Navigation)
This Python script uses the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm to navigate a robot from a starting point to a target point in a 2D space with obstacles.
This code is meant to navigate a robot between locations in a two dimensional domain with obstacles. Given as input the current and target coordinates of a robot, as well as the top left and bottom right points of rectangular obstacles. This code produces a feasible path from the starting point to the target point without going through any of the obstacles(no collisions).

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install matplotlib to visualise the path:
