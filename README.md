# Rapidly-exploring-Random-Trees
navigate between locations in a two dimensional domain with obstacles. given as input the current and target coordinates of a robot, as well as the top left and bottom right points of rectangular obstacles. This code produces a feasible path from the starting point to the target point without going through any of the obstacles(no collisions).
